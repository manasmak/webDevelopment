        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1><br>
          Dear Eileen, <br>
          Thank you for your recent application to join us at the 
          University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
          of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
          <h2>Starting dates</h2><br>
          We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
          could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
          <ul>
              <li>First semester: <date class="semester-dates">9 September 2016</date></li>
              <li>Second semester: <date class="semester-dates">15 January 2017</date></li>
              <li>Third Semester: <date class="semester-dates">2 May 2017</date></li></ul><br>
          Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
          You can find more information about <a href="www.example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.<br>
          <h2>Subjects of study</h2><br>
          At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded 
          research facility &hyphen; as long as the subjects fall <br>
          somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, 
          and just<br>
          the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
          by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
          <ol>
              <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of 
                  Resveratol &#40;C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#41;.</li>
              <li>Lorem ipsum 30&deg;C &#40;86&deg;F&#41; 3 x 10<sup>3</sup></li>
              <li><u>Lorem</u> Ipsum</li>
          </ol>
